# Kelpie Demo

This repository contains the code for a simple demonstration of the [Kelpie Framework](https://github.com/AndRossi/Kelpie) to explain embedding-based Link Prediction models on Knowledge Graphs. 

The Kelpie Framework has been presented with a [research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514221.3517887) at the [SIGMOD 2022](https://2022.sigmod.org/) conference.

The Kelpie Demonstration will be presented at the [VLDB 2022](https://vldb.org/2022/) conference.
